    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain on the Intel Developer Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a novel approach that combines the strengths of large-scale retrieval systems with the generative capabilities of transformers like GPT. In a RAG-based system, when a question is posed, relevant documents or passages are retrieved from a corpus, and then fed alongside the query to a generative model. This two-step process enables the model to leverage both external knowledge from the corpus and its internal knowledge to produce more informed and contextually accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. In-context Learning:\n",
    "Traditional machine learning models learn from extensive labeled datasets. In contrast, in-context learning pertains to models, especially language models, leveraging a few examples or context provided at inference time to tailor their outputs. This technique allows LLMs to be dynamically adapted to new tasks without undergoing explicit fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LLM Chains/Pipelines:\n",
    "LLM chains or pipelines involve stringing together multiple stages or components of a system to achieve a complex task. For instance, in a RAG system, a retrieval component fetches relevant data from a database, followed by a generation component that constructs the final answer. By chaining different LLM modules, developers can build systems that harness diverse capabilities and can be modularly updated or optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. RAG for On-Premise LLM Applications:\n",
    "With the growing need for data privacy and proprietary data handling, many enterprises seek solutions to harness the power of LLMs in-house. RAG provides a unique opportunity for such use-cases. By integrating RAG with on-premise data repositories, enterprises can build powerful LLM applications tailored to their specific needs, while ensuring data confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. RAG vs Fine-Tuning:\n",
    "While RAG is a powerful approach on its own, it can also be combined with fine-tuning to enhance LLM capabilities further. Fine-tuning allows models to be explicitly trained on specific datasets, honing them for certain tasks. When coupled with RAG, fine-tuned models can make informed decisions using retrieved external knowledge, yielding even more precise and task-specific results."

    "The code below builds RAGBot. RAGBot class is a streamlined implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, designed to integrate large language models for generating contextually relevant responses. At its core, it manages the downloading of specific language models, such as the \"Falcon\" model, with support for handling large model files. It also automates the process of fetching and structuring dialogue datasets from predefined sources. The chatbot utilizes the GPT4All model, which is adjustable for various operational parameters like the number of threads and maximum tokens, to enhance response generation efficiency. A key feature of RAGBot is its ability to build a vector database for text retrieval, significantly bolstering its ability to pull relevant document snippets based on user queries. This functionality, combined with a retrieval mechanism and an inference method, makes RAGBot a simple tool for developers aiming to learn about RAG and leverage this implementation as a basis for their implementation."

    "# Customizing Your RAG LLM Chatbot Experience\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Welcome to the RAG LLM Chatbot interface! This guide will help you understand how to use the various widgets to customize your chatbot experience.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Interface Elements\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Model Selection\r\n",
    "- **Model Dropdown**: Choose the model for your chatbot.\r\n",
    "  - Available options include 'Falcon' and 'More Models Coming Soon!'.\r\n",
    "  - This dropdown allows you to select the underlying model your chatbot will use for generating responses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Query Input\r\n",
    "- **Query Text Box**: Enter your query here.\r\n",
    "  - Type the question or statement you want the chatbot to respond to.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Response Customization\r\n",
    "- **Top K Slider**: Adjust the number of top results to consider for generating responses.\r\n",
    "  - Slide to increase or decrease the value. The range is from 1 to 4.\r\n",
    "  - This adjusts how many top possibilities the model considers when crafting a response.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **RAG OFF Checkbox**: Toggle whether to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or not.\r\n",
    "  - Check this box if you want to turn off RAG and use only the raw model and prompt for inference.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Data Processing Settings\r\n",
    "- **Chunk Size Input**: Set the size of text chunks for processing.\r\n",
    "  - Enter a value to determine how large each text chunk should be. The range is from 5 to 5000.\r\n",
    "  - This affects how the text data is segmented for analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Overlap Input**: Define the overlap size between chunks.\r\n",
    "  - Set a value for how much overlap there should be between text chunks. The range is from 0 to 1000.\r\n",
    "  - This can influence the continuity in data processing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Dataset and Performance\r\n",
    "- **Dataset Dropdown**: Choose the dataset for training your model.\r\n",
    "  - Select from options like 'robot maintenance', 'basketball coach', 'physics professor', 'grocery cashier'.\r\n",
    "  - The dataset selected will be used to train and inform the chatbot's responses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Threads Slider**: Select the number of threads for parallel processing.\r\n",
    "  - Adjust the slider to set the number of threads. The range is from 2 to 200.\r\n",
    "  - This setting can affect the performance and speed of your model's processing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Max Tokens Input**: Specify the maximum number of tokens for model prediction.\r\n",
    "  - Enter a value to set the limit for the number of tokens. The range is from 5 to 500.\r\n",
    "  - This sets a cap on the length of the generated responses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Submit Button\r\n",
    "- **Submit**: Click this button to process your input and generate a response.\r\n",
    "  - Once you have set all your parameters, click here to see the chatbot in action!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## How to Use\r\n",
    "1. Select your desired model from the **Model Dropdown**.\r\n",
    "2. Type your query in the **Query Text Box**.\r\n",
    "3. Adjust the **Top K Slider** to set the number of top results for response generation.\r\n",
    "4. Check or uncheck the **RAG OFF Checkbox** based on your preference.\r\n",
    "5. Set the **Chunk Size** and **Overlap** for data processing.\r\n",
    "6. Choose a dataset from the **Dataset Dropdown**.\r\n",
    "7. Adjust the **Threads Slider** and **Max Tokens Input** for performance.\r\n",
    "8\n",
    "\n",
    "*The first execution will load the model into memory, adding additional overhead. The model will not be reloaded unless you change model specific initialization parameters like threads or max tokens.*\n",
    ". Click **Submit** to generate and display the response.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Enjoy interacting with your custom RAG LLM Chatbot!"
